A simple gauge written with D3.js that can be easily included in a project.

The base code was used from [this example](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/WKyXgr) on CodePen and from
[this tutorial](https://jaketrent.com/post/rotate-gauge-needle-in-d3/). I refactored the code of the example to make
it work with D3.js v5, and I restructured the code to make it more flexible. Thanks to the original author ([Jack Trent](https://github.com/jaketrent)) for its work.

A [demo](https://www.antoinebeland.com/d3-simple-gauge/) of the gauge is available on my personal website.

Quick Start
-----------
The first step you need to do before to use the script is to include [D3.js v5](https://github.com/d3/d3) in your
project.

Once you have included D3 in your dependencies, you have the following options to use the script:

- Use the latest [version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoinebeland/d3-simple-gauge/master/dist/d3-simple-gauge.js)
of the master branch (see `dist` folder)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/antoinebeland/d3-simple-gauge.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-simple-gauge): `npm install d3-simple-gauge`

Be sure to include `d3-simple-gauge.js` file in your project before to start.

Usage
-----
The gauge is very simple to use. You only have to initialize a new instance of the gauge with a configuration
like in the following example to make it work. Once the gauge is initialized, you can set the percentage position of
the needle with the `percent` or `value` properties.

```javascript
const svg = d3.select('body')
  .append('svg')
  .attr('width', 400)
  .attr('height', 250);

const simpleGauge = new window.d3SimpleGauge.SimpleGauge({
  el: svg.append('g'),        // The element that hosts the gauge
  height: 200,                // The height of the gauge
  interval: [0, 200],         // The interval (min and max values) of the gauge (optional)
  sectionsCount: 2,           // The number of sections in the gauge
  width: 400                  // The width of the gauge
});

setTimeout(() => {
  simpleGauge.percent = 0.7;  // The new percent of the needle to set (70%)

  setTimeout(() => {
    simpleGauge.value = 42;  // The new value of the needle to set inside the interval (21%)
  }, 1500);
}, 1500);
```
This script is written in ECMAScript 6 and is transpiled in [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) format. So, you can
import it easily as a module. Look at the following examples to know how to import it:

```javascript
// In an ES6 application
import { SimpleGauge } from './path/to/script/d3-simple-gauge';

// In the browser
const SimpleGauge = window.d3SimpleGauge.SimpleGauge
```

### Configuration
The gauge can be easily customized with the following parameters when you create a new instance of `SimpleGauge` class.
There are only four required parameters when you create a gauge. The others are optional (noted between `[]`).

| Name                  | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[animationDelay]`    | The delay in ms before to start the needle animation. By default, the value is `0`.       |
| `[animationDuration]` | The duration in ms of the needle animation. By default, the value is `3000`.              |
| `[barWidth]`          | The bar width of the gauge. By default, the value is `40`.                                |
| `[chartInset]`        | The inset (margins) of the gauge inside the SVG container. By default the value is `10`.  |
| `[easeType]`          | The ease type to use for the needle animation. By default, the value is `d3.easeElastic`. |
| `el`                  | The D3 element to use to create the gauge (must be a group or an SVG element).            |
| `height`              | The height of the gauge.                                                                  |
| `[interval]`          | The interval (min and max values) of the gauge. By default, the interval is `[0, 1]`.     |
| `[needleColor]`       | The color to use for the needle.                                                          |
| `[needleRadius]`      | The radius of the needle. By default, the radius is `15`.                                 |
| `[percent]`           | The percentage to use for the needle position. By default, the value is `0`.              |
| `[sectionsColors]`    | An array that contains the color to apply for each section.                               |
| `sectionsCount`       | The number of sections in the gauge.                                                      |
| `width`               | The width of the gauge.                                                                   |

### Properties
Once the gauge is initialized, you can use the following properties to manipulate it.

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```interval```  | Gets or sets the interval of the gauge (min and max values).                                                                                                                    |
| ```percent```   | Gets or sets the percentage of the gauge. The percent must be between [0,&nbsp;1].                                                                                                   |
| ```value```     | Sets the needle position based on the specified value inside the interval. If the value specified is outside the interval, the value will be clamped to fit inside the domain.  |

### Style
To apply colors on the gauge, you can specify them with the `needleColor` and `sectionsColors` properties in the
configuration or with CSS classes.

If you choose to use `needleColor` and `sectionsColors` properties to set colors, be sure to specify these properties
in the configuration like in the following example. Noted that the color specified should be a valid
[CSS color](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_colors.asp).

```js
{
  // ...
  needleColor: 'black', // The needle color
  sectionsColors: [     // The color of each section
    'green',
    '#ffa500',
    'rgb(255, 0, 0)'
  ]
}
```

You can use CSS classes too to apply colors on the gauge. There are two classes used to set the needle colors
(`needle` and `needle-center`), and there is one class for each group generated (`chart-color{i}`), where `{i}` is a
number between 1 and the groups count, to apply a specific color to a group. You can take a look at the following
example to know how to use these classes.

```css
/* Fill color for the first group */
.chart-color1 {
  fill: #dea82c;
}

/* Fill color for the second group */
.chart-color2 {
  fill: #e9621a;
}

/* Fill color for the third group */
.chart-color3 {
  fill: #e92213;
}

/* Fill color for the needle */
.needle,
.needle-center {
  fill: #464A4F;
}
```

There are also other classes that can be used. Based on the percentage of the gauge, the arc points out by the needle
has the `active` class. This can be useful if you want to apply a different style to the active group. Also, when the
minimum (0%) or the maximum (100%) of the gauge are reached, the gauge element has `min` or `max` classes. Look at the
following examples to know how to use these classes.

```css
/* Put the active group always in black */
.arc.active {
  fill: #000;
}

/* When the gauge is at 0%, all the arcs appear blue */
.min .arc {
  fill: #00f;
}

/* When the gauge is at 100%, all the arcs appear red */
.max .arc {
  fill: #f00;
}
```

If you have used `sectionsColor` properties to set group colors, you have to add `!important` rule with the
`fill` property if you want that `active`, `min` or `max` classes can be applied.
